# General-Projects-Data-Analysis
The motivation behind creating this repo is to continue learning and practicing Data Analysis techniques during my leisure time, while serving as a reference for people trying to learn from the internet.  

This repo contains extra-curricular projects which are highly focussed towards analysis of data. The main idea is to take up a publicly available data, come up with few questions and answer them with the help of Data Analysis and visualization using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

While I have strated off with simple projects, I intend to dive deep into core Data Analysis and Machine Learning techniques as I have done in my https://github.com/Ab2207/Academic-Projects-Data-Analytics repo.
