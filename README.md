# General-Projects-Data-Analysis
The motivation for creating this repo is to continue learning Data Analysis techniques and practice them religiously, while serving as a reference for people trying to learn from the internet.  

This repo contains extra-curricular projects highly focussed towards analysis of data. The main idea is to take up a publicly available data, come up with few questions and answer them with the help of Data Analysis and visualization using Python and Jupyter Notebook. This helps keep the code organized and pleases the eyes :) 

While I have strated off with simple projects, I intend to dive deep into core Data Analysis and Machine Learning techniques as I have done in my https://github.com/Ab2207/Academic-Projects-Data-Analytics repo.
